	- affiliations
	- warren (dt.: Gewirr)
- Character relations  
	as directed edges for
	- love
	- hate
	- known
	- killed
	- blood relations
- Book appearances and events
	- first appearance of characters in books
	- acquaintance and relation developments
	- congruency events
- Timeline of characters and relations
	- birth and death dates
	- acquaintances
- Map of the world
	- continents
	- cities
	- warrens
	- events
